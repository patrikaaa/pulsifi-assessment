### 1. Consistency
- In the Git repository, define separate branches (sandbox, staging, production) to map to different environments. This approach isolates different stages of the deployment pipeline.
- Prepare your own IaC template to provision and configure resources in your cloud provider so that the infrastructure can be reused and is standardized.

### 2. Pipeline
- Configure webhook triggers in Jenkins to automate the deployment jobs
- Integrate SonarQube for static code analysis. It can scan for code quality issues and vulnerabilities. Then it will provide reports that are visible to both DevOps and QA.
- After it passes the code analysis stage, use Jenkins jobs to automate Docker image builds and push them to a container registry of your choice. Divide each environment into it's own Jenkins job or pipeline stage for isolation purpose.
- We can also use Jenkins to manage secrets or environment variables in settings.

### 3. Testing
- Ensure any new features or code changes are tested in sandbox/staging environments first
- Allow QA to test the new features and get approval from necessary people (like Team Lead) before deploying them to production.
