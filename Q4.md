### 1. **VPC Configuration**
   - Isolate each project infrastructure with the VPC.
   - Create private and public subnets as needed, placing resources in the appropriate subnet based on their requirements.

### 2. **Security Groups**
   - Configure security groups rules to restrict inbound traffic. Allow only specific IP addresses or ranges to access the server on required ports (e.g., SSH on port 22 from the engineer's home IP).

### 3. **Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)**
   - Use NACLs to set rules to deny specific traffic based on IP addresses.

### 4. **IAM Management**
   - Assign an IAM role to the EC2 instance that grants minimal permissions necessary for the engineer's tasks.
   - Ensure the engineer has an IAM user account with permissions only to access the resources they need. Use policies to restrict access to other AWS services.

### 5. **Server Access**
   - Store the SSH key securely and ensure the access is limited.
   - Alternatively, we can set up a bastion host (jump server) in the VPC public subnet. The engineer can SSH into the bastion host, which then allows access to the private instances. Only allow access to the bastion host from specific IP addresses.

### 6. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Enable AWS CloudTrail to log API calls made by the engineer. This helps monitor activity and identify any unauthorized access.
   - Create alarms for unusual activity, such as login attempts from unauthorized IPs or changes to security group rules.
