### 1. Manage
- Implement RBAC to assign access permissions based on roles and grant only the minimum required permissions for each role.
- Such as read only roles or allow access to specific tables.

### 2. Authentication and Authorization
- Use MFA for accessing database management tools.
- Integrate IAM system to centralize permissions (if on cloud).
- Enforce password rotations regularly.

### 3. Logging and Monitoring
- Enable logging on all database access events, including login attempts and data modifications.
- Configure Cloudtrail to send logs to Cloudwatch and set alarms based on certain metrics filters.
  
### 4. Change Approval and Testing
- Ensure there is a separate db schema for staging and production, and run tests on staging before running in production.
- Obtain approval from key stakeholders (e.g., data owners, compliance officers) for schema changes, especially if sensitive data tables are impacted.

## 3. Data Backup and Recovery
- Schedule automated daily backups of the production database and ensure backups are securely stored.
- Periodically test the backup recovery process to verify that data can be restored successfully.
