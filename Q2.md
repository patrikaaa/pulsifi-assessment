### Access Control
- Implement RBAC to assign access permissions based on roles.
- Grant only the minimum required permissions for each role

### Authentication and Authorization
- Use **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for accessing database management tools.
- Integrate access control with an **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** system if possible (e.g., AWS IAM for RDS or Google Cloud IAM for Cloud SQL) to centralize permissions.
- Enforce password policies, including **regular password rotations** and complexity requirements.

### Audit Logging and Monitoring
- Enable logging on all database access events, including login attempts and data modifications.
- Set up alerts for **unauthorized access attempts** or **suspicious queries** (e.g., large data exports).
- Regularly review access logs and periodically **audit user permissions** to detect and revoke unnecessary access.


### Change Approval and Testing
- Use a **staging environment** to test schema changes before applying them to production.
- Conduct **performance testing** to verify that schema changes wonâ€™t impact production performance.
- Obtain approval from key stakeholders (e.g., data owners, compliance officers) for schema changes, especially if sensitive data tables are impacted.

## 3. Data Backup and Recovery

### Regular Backups
- Schedule **automated daily backups** of the production database and ensure backups are securely stored (e.g., using encryption at rest).
- Periodically test the backup recovery process to verify that data can be restored successfully.

### Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)
- Enable **PITR** if the database engine supports it, allowing you to restore to a specific timestamp in case of data corruption or accidental changes.
